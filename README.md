This package includes a cursory analysis of demographical data from Gervais et al.'s paper on bias against athists.  

After cloning the repository and installing the R dependencies listed in `DESCRIPTION`, the analysis, output files, and `html` version of the analysis script can be recreated from the command line by calling `Rscript -e "rmarkdown::render('01_data.R')"`, then running calling `Rscript -e "rmarkdown::render('01_data.R')"` within the `scripts` directory. Alternatively, if `make` is installed, call `make all` from the command line within the top folder of the repository.
